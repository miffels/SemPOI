Close to Alexanderplatz, the tower was constructed between 1965 and 1969 by the administration of the German Democratic Republic. It was intended as a symbol of Berlin, which it remains today, as it is easily visible throughout the central and some suburban districts of Berlin. With its height of 368 meters, it is the tallest structure in Germany.","pictures":["http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3487/3215109674_db86f3cf89_m.jpg","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3366/3215108952_e1c2e165e5_m.jpg","http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4910946492_ff3536d765_m.jpg","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3149/2772504524_8ddd9fe21d_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8193/8088722146_50572b5bbd_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8331/8088719651_ee5ba30628_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8330/8088719557_a9ed742878_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8475/8088722444_7aaa19fb76_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8328/8088719455_7bd12fd094_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8331/8088720078_bc41c2b456_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8187/8088719311_d590673789_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8465/8088719962_390f792c43_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8332/8088723961_fe83d9d924_m.jpg","http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6204/6099434775_1bb4d76044_m.jpg","http://farm1.static.flickr.com/30/61680712_be851a2b10_m.jpg","http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7027/6545167225_15bc360a85_m.jpg","http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7019/6545126153_7d1eb16cdd_m.jpg","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3042/2704554965_9e00849e91_m.jpg","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3062/2995405643_e9030519e2_m.jpg","http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1388/1270527562_751278f562_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8472/8088722513_95e5d2d991_m.jpg","http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8325/8088722780_b148bb3d0d_m.jpg","http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2738/4470713756_5f5d48684b_m.jpg","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5023/5654287858_3c8cdd878a_m.jpg","http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3421/3986910052_6d534736a2_m.jpg","http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4002/5077228241_143dd2ccf9_m.jpg","http://farm1.static.flickr.com/61/197054843_0f3ecc42d1_m.jpg","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5272/7416834200_da1789c530_m.jpg","http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5350/7416731342_065596bbe3_m.jpg","http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1287/1140535124_e7d6f34129_m.jpg"],"wikiUrl":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm_Berlin"},{"name":"Kaufhaus des Westens","location":{"lat":52.501667,"lng":13.341111},"description":"The Kaufhaus des Westens (English \"Department Store of the West\"), usually abbreviated to KaDeWe), is a department store in Berlin.
